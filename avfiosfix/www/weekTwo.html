				<p>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?
	To begin with, I been changing my HTML code around for it to be more understanding to me but in my final change of my HTML code I been using a lot of div tags. In regards to this discussion I do not have my application designed to be accessible because I really forgot about that concept. By doing the research I learned how I could improve my application by using an accessibility validator. The accessibility validator would look through my HTML code and show me what seems to be not accessible and by using that tool I can input attributes to make it more accessible. The first concept I would add is the alternative text, which allows users who are using screen readers, have their images turned off, or are using a tool to help them know what are the images that are on the application or web site being displayed. In addition I would implement the noframes element that allows screen readers and any other tools to work and be able to be used by search engines. Compared to just using frames, which does not work very well with screen readers and with robots that are used for the search engines. The noframes element is sort of a copy of the original application or website but hardly users know about it because it’s mainly used for users that accessibility feature so it does not have to be very graphically designed but has to be readable and understandable. 
Common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
	After seeing videos of the types of attributes that are in the ARIA live regions such as aria-live and aria-atomic I’ve noticed how it works with screen readers such as Jaws eleven. One issue that caught my attention was when theirs multiple changes in a page the screen reader does not mention it if the correct attribute is not in the code. With regards of me fixing such an issue I do not know how to answer, only I could say is adding the correct attribute the same way as it was demonstrated in the video. 
Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility:
	The first device that supports accessibility is the iPhone5 running on IOS 6. Some of the features include VoiceOver, screen reader, screen magnification, playback of closed-captioned videos, mono audio and reverse video, and many more. The second device would be an Android phone running on the operating system Jelly Bean 4.1. The feature under accessibility includes gesture mode, focus, text traversal, talk back, and more.  
Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility:
	The first application is called Proloquo2G0 that works for IOS and it’s from the company AssistiveWare. The application allows users who a speaking disability to communication with others by having built-in natural sounding speech voices that produces text-to-text, symbols, conjugations, and more. The second application is called Spiel, which is similar to Talk Back but one key difference is that it uses synthesized speech in order to describe actions and events.
